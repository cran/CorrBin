Description: Implements non-parametric analyses for clustered
    binary and multinomial data. The elements of the cluster are assumed
    exchangeable, and identical joint distribution (also known as marginal
    compatibility, or reproducibility) is assumed for clusters of different
    sizes. A trend test based on stochastic ordering is implemented.
